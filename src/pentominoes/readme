Each line in the CSV file uses 4+ values to define one permutation of a pentomino.
- First value is the ID for a pentomino, from 0 to 11.
- Second value is the index of the permutation (rotation, flip, etc.), between 0 to 7.
- Third and fourth values are the X and Y sizes respectively.
- The remaining values define an X*Y matrix, displaying the shape of the pentomino.

This file does not contain a header.
The pentominoes are sorted by ID in increasing order

EXAMPLE:

2,1,3,3,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,1

ID: 2
Permutation: 1
X: 3 squares
Y: 3 squares
Shape:
X 0 0
X X X
0 0 X
